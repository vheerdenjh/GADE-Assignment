# GADE-Assignment
This repository is used to keep track of the previous versions of my assignment.

The file, Assignment 1 contains the progression from Assignment 1 to the end of Assignment 2. I did this because I did
not know that this would become a Task later on in the project and because it did not state that we has to start each assignment as
a new file. But here it is, what I have at the end of Assignment 2 is inside the Assignment 1 file.
